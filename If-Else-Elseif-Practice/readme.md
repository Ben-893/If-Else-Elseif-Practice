# This is a set of 3 apps I made using JavaScript to practice else-if statements.

## To install
```
git clone https://github.com/Ben-893/If-Else-Elseif-Practice 

## To Use
```
Open the folder in your text editor

Depending on which app you would like to use, 'booleans', 'conditionals', 'else-if', update the script tag in index.html with the correct path to that file

Right click on the index file, and then Open with Google Chrome, or whatever browser you're using

Have fun! :)
